        <h2>The Birth of Texas oil</h2>
        <p>
          On August 27, 1859, George H. Bissell and his friends struck oil at a
          depth of 69 feet near Titusville. This is the first recorded time that
          oil was struck, and this started the birth of the modern oil industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          After this, towns around Titusville and areas around the U.S. struck
          oil too, which made everyone start looking for oil. All of the U.S.
          began searching for oil to gain massive amounts of money for
          themselves.
